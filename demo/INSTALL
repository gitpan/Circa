Update this script:

admin.pl                 : Command line interface to indexer
search.pl                : Command line interface to searcher
cgi-bin/admin_compte.cgi : CGI Interface for administrate one account
cgi-bin/admin.cgi        : General CGI Interface for indexer
cgi-bin/search.cgi       : CGI Interace to searcher

And set this:

my $user = "alian";  # set your database User
my $pass = "";       # set your database password
my $db    = "circa"; # set your database name

For the CGI file, set too this:

my $rep = "/home/alian/project/Circa/Indexer/demo/ecrans/";
where your html admin files are

Then, you can do:

In command line:
admin.pl +create +add=http://www.monsite.com +parse_new=1 +depth_max
for index your first url.

Then for make a search, you can do:
search.pl +word='my word'

With CGI: 
Just run admin.cgi or search.cgi
